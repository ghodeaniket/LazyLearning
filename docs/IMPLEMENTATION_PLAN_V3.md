## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive phase-wise implementation plan for the Lazy Learner Scaling MVP, incorporating React Native best practices for 2025 with a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach while maintaining MVP-first delivery focus. Version 1.2 adds Git workflow and GitHub Actions CI/CD best practices.

---

## üîÑ Git & CI/CD Strategy

### Git Branching Strategy: GitHub Flow

**Why GitHub Flow:**
- Simple and effective for continuous delivery
- Perfect for small to medium teams
- Supports rapid iteration and deployment
- Aligns with modern DevOps practices

**Branch Structure:**
```
main (production-ready)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/auth-implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/game-mechanics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fix/login-validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chore/update-dependencies
```

**Workflow Rules:**
1. `main` branch is always deployable
2. Create descriptive feature branches from `main`
3. Open PR early for visibility
4. Require code reviews before merge
5. Deploy immediately after merge to `main`

### Conventional Commits

**Commit Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (MINOR version)
- `fix`: Bug fix (PATCH version)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): implement email/password authentication
fix(game): correct score calculation for hard mode
test(utils): add unit tests for game utilities
ci: add GitHub Actions workflow for iOS builds
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
.github/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml          # Continuous Integration
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cd-staging.yml  # Deploy to staging
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cd-prod.yml     # Deploy to production
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ codeql.yml      # Security scanning
```

**CI Pipeline Features:**
1. **Trigger on PR**: Run tests on every pull request
2. **Matrix Testing**: Test on multiple Node versions
3. **Parallel Jobs**: Run iOS and Android tests concurrently
4. **Caching**: Cache dependencies for faster builds
5. **Coverage Reports**: Upload to Codecov
6. **Status Checks**: Block merge if tests fail

**CD Pipeline Features:**
1. **Automatic Staging Deploy**: Deploy to staging on merge to main
2. **Manual Production Deploy**: Require approval for production
3. **Version Tagging**: Automatic semantic versioning
4. **Release Notes**: Generate from conventional commits
5. **App Distribution**: Upload to TestFlight/Play Console

## üéØ Testing Strategy Overview

### TDD Principles for MVP
- **Write tests first** for core functionality only
- **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle for critical paths
- **80% coverage target** for business logic
- **60% coverage acceptable** for UI in MVP phase
- **Integration tests** prioritized over unit tests for faster MVP delivery

### Test Pyramid for MVP
1. **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical user journeys only
2. **Integration Tests (30%)**: API, database, and service layer
3. **Unit Tests (60%)**: Business logic, utilities, and hooks

Sprint 3-4: AI Agent Learning Framework (Week 5-8)
ü§ñ AI Agent Architecture Implementation
Sprint Objective:
Build the AI Agent system that dynamically generates personalized interactive learning experiences for system design concepts.
Git Workflow for Agent Development:
bash# Create main feature branch
git checkout -b feature/ai-agent-framework

# Sub-branches for components
git checkout -b feature/ai-agent-framework-protocol
git checkout -b feature/ai-agent-framework-renderer
git checkout -b feature/ai-agent-framework-llm-integration
Week 5-6: Agent Foundation & Communication
1. Agent Communication Protocol
TDD Approach:
typescript// Write tests first
describe('AgentCommunicationProtocol', () => {
  it('should parse render_scenario messages correctly', () => {
    const message = {
      type: 'render_scenario',
      concept: 'load_balancing',
      elements: [...]
    };
    expect(parseAgentMessage(message)).toMatchSnapshot();
  });

  it('should handle malformed messages gracefully', () => {
    const badMessage = { type: 'unknown' };
    expect(() => parseAgentMessage(badMessage)).not.toThrow();
  });
});
Implementation Focus:

Message format specification (JSON-based)
State synchronization protocol
Action/response patterns
Error handling & fallbacks
Offline message queuing

2. Dynamic Component Renderer
Core Component Library:
typescript// Base components for agent to orchestrate
- InteractiveVisualization
- ConceptExplainer
- MetricsDisplay
- FeedbackCollector
- ProgressTracker
Rendering Engine Features:

Parse agent instructions to React Native components
Handle dynamic layouts
Manage interaction state
Performance optimization for smooth animations

Testing Strategy:
typescript// Component rendering tests
describe('DynamicRenderer', () => {
  it('should render server visualization from agent spec', () => {
    const agentSpec = {
      type: 'server_group',
      count: 3,
      layout: 'horizontal'
    };
    const { getByTestId } = render(
      <DynamicRenderer spec={agentSpec} />
    );
    expect(getByTestId('server-0')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
3. Learning State Manager
State Architecture:
typescriptinterface LearningState {
  userId: string;
  knowledgeGraph: {
    concepts: Map<string, ConceptMastery>;
    connections: Edge[];
  };
  currentSession: {
    concept: string;
    startTime: number;
    interactions: Interaction[];
    understanding: number; // 0-1 scale
  };
  preferences: {
    learningStyle: 'visual' | 'interactive' | 'textual';
    pacePreference: 'slow' | 'medium' | 'fast';
  };
}
Week 7-8: Agent Intelligence & LLM Integration
4. Agent Orchestration Logic
Core Responsibilities:
typescriptclass LearningAgent {
  async assessUnderstanding(interactions: Interaction[]): Promise<number>;
  async generateNextScenario(state: LearningState): Promise<Scenario>;
  async adaptDifficulty(performance: Performance): Promise<void>;
  async provideFeedback(action: UserAction): Promise<Feedback>;
}
Testing Approach:

Mock LLM responses for deterministic tests
Test adaptation algorithms with various user profiles
Validate state transitions
Performance benchmarking

5. LLM Integration Layer
Prompt Engineering:
typescriptconst generateScenarioPrompt = (context: LearningContext) => `
  Create an interactive learning scenario for ${context.concept}.
  User level: ${context.level}
  Learning style: ${context.style}
  Previous struggles: ${context.weakAreas}
  
  Return a JSON structure with visual elements and interactions.
`;
Integration Features:

Structured prompt templates
Response validation and sanitization
Token usage optimization
Fallback content strategy
Response caching for common scenarios

6. Feedback Loop Implementation
User Action Processing:
typescript// Real-time adaptation based on user actions
async function processUserAction(action: UserAction) {
  // Update local state immediately
  updateLocalState(action);
  
  // Send to agent for processing
  const agentResponse = await agent.processAction(action);
  
  // Apply agent's feedback
  applyFeedback(agentResponse);
  
  // Trigger next content if needed
  if (agentResponse.advanceToNext) {
    generateNextContent();
  }
}
